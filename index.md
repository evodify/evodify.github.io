I am passionate about addressing complex biological and medical challenges through computational solutions.

My background combines a lifelong passion for biology and a hobbyist's interest in programming, which ultimately allowed me to thrive in the evolving field of bioinformatics.

With over a decade of experience, I specialize in creating robust pipelines for large-scale bioinformatics analysis, utilizing R, Python, and Bash. I emphasize reproducibility and efficiency in every project by incorporating tools like Git for version control, Snakemake/Netflow for workflow management, Conda/Docker for environment control, and R Markdown for clear and effective communication.

In my current role, I lead bioinformatics analysis development at the [Lund University Diabetes Center (LUDC)](https://www.ludc.lu.se/resources/ludc-bioinformatics-unit){:target="\_blank"}, where I am dedicated to advancing research in diabetes and related areas.
